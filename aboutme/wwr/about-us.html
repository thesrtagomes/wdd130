            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              Meet the Rios, a Brazilian family with a heart as big as the Lone
              Star State. They struck it rich in the oil game, but their real
              wealth? Joy. The clan decided to spread that joy far and wide, so
              they poured their fortunes into a whitewater rafting company.
              Picture this: The Rios, living high and mighty, swapping oil
              rigs for river rafts. Now, they're on a mission to bring smiles to
              faces, thrill-seekers and families alike, ensuring that every ride
              down those rapids is a ticket to pure, unadulterated joy. It's a
              Brazil-sized promise, y'all, and they're making waves, literally.
