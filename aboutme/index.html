    <p>
      &nbsp;I am Pamela Gomes, a new student of Web Development. I am a tech
      enthusiast! I was born and raised in Brazil, which is a lovely country. I
      am 24 years old. Something about me is that I am an animal lover, student,
      returned missionary, and future Web Developer. From a young age, I've had
      a deep curiosity about the world and a desire to make a meaningful
      contribution to society.

      &nbsp; I've always imagined the vast possibilities out there and how I
      could leave a positive mark on the world. When I discovered the field of
      Information Technology, I realized it was a perfect fit for my goals, as
      it offers the opportunity to connect with people from remote places and
      make a difference in their lives through technology. I'm driven by my
      desire to make a positive difference in the world, and I believe that
      pursuing a career in information technology is the best way to achieve
      this goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;I'm excited to continue to learn and grow in this field and to use
      my passion for innovation and creativity to make a meaningful contribution
      to society.
